# Customer_Account_Analysis_Pipeline_Cycle26

The project aims to design and implement a robust data pipeline for processing customer account data. 
This includes copying data from a backend team's storage account, performing necessary transformations using Data factory data from a file stored in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) GOLD Storage into a dedicated SQL table in ADF.
It uses Azure Data Factory to build and run the pipelines effectively.
